# RM-YOLOv8-pose-Openvino
This repository is based on the YOLOv8-Pose model, and it is deployed using C++ and OpenVINO with the Inference Engine library to accelerate the inference process.

YOLOv8-Pose is a human pose estimation model based on YOLOv5, which aims to estimate multiple human poses from a single image. OpenVINO is a deep learning inference framework provided by Intel that helps developers deploy deep learning models on Intel hardware for efficient inference calculations. Inference Engine is part of OpenVINO and provides the inference functionality for deep learning models. It can convert trained models into deployable models and perform efficient inference calculations on Intel hardware.

By using OpenVINO and Inference Engine, deep learning models can be deployed on Intel hardware for efficient inference calculations. During the deployment process, trained models need to be converted to the IR (Intermediate Representation) format supported by OpenVINO, and Inference Engine is used for inference calculations. Since OpenVINO supports multiple hardware platforms, models can be deployed on different hardware for efficient inference calculations.

Overall, this repository uses popular deep learning models and inference frameworks to achieve efficient pose estimation. If you are interested in this area, you can further study it.
